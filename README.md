## Info

This is a learning project, as well as a challenge to myself.

The main goals are :
- [x] possible moves highlighted when picking a piece up
- [ ] an intuitive UI, with the ability to drag & drop pieces on the board
- [ ] a brute force "AI" (in the sense of, an artifical adversary, not based on actual AI)
  - [ ] customizable depth of analysis

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.
